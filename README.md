## _Description_ ✏️
This is my final project for the subject _Diseño Web I (ISO-305)_ from UNAPEC, it is about the user interface of a project management platform, as well as Jira Software and Azure DevOps, called **Alpha Management**, in which the creation of 5 views is requested: The control panel, the creation of a new project, the archive of all projects, human resources and the login. The project was created in Visual Studio Code and is made purely with **HTML** and **CSS**.
